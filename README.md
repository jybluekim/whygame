Dad: In this file, you will each fill in ONE reason to why you should have a game time. 

Have fun!!

Lexi: We should have game time because it is fun and kids have been waiting the whole week to play, the kids will be sad if you don't let us have game time.

Drew: We should have game time because of many reasons, but I'll only say the most important one. We, kids are getting older. This not only means we get more mature, but we also get a lot of work from school and outside of school stuff. If this sin't clear, I might as well give you an example. Imagine if you are a runner. As you run, slowly, you need water and food. Without it, the person would die. I'm not saying that we are gonna die if we don't get to play games but, you know. The point is, we are extremeley busy in our everyday life as we go through a lot of hard stuff. If we don't get anything or do anything to relieve our stress, then we might do bad in school. So the conclusion is, if you try to work to hard, it might backfire as you might make a mistake. If you get something fun to do, then it gives you another reason to work hard in school. 

Dad: 
What is the meaing of mean? There are two major meanings. 1) verb and 2) adjective. Why don't you answer that?

I meant the adjective.
